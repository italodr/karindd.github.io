            <p>Travel is a fictional space-traveling agency specialized in trips to the red planet, Mars. The company needed a landing page to advertise its services and acquire leads for their trips.</p>
            <p>This project was an exercise that was focused on putting UI best practices into work, which is why there is no prior research as the task was focused on visual design process.</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
<p>A case study to put visual design best practices and processes into work, by creating the UI of a landing page.</p>
    <h3>Users</h3>
<p>Millionaires with a taste for exclusive and extraordinary adventures.</p>

<p>Step one before starting the lo-fi wireframing was to review the content, in order to prioritize it during the design process. Putting content first allowed me to adapt the structure to the content to see what worked or not. Knowing what elements and texts needed to be included in the UI was a helpful creative constraint when testing different types of landing page structures.

    After doing some sketches I developed the high-fi wireframes in Miro in order to add the texts and more details. The objective was to test different user flows while still maintain the focus on the content, usability, and structure.</p>
